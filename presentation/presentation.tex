\begin{frame}{Project Goals}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Use Olufsen's thesis to implement similar 1-D code in Matlab
	\item
	%These need to be filled in
	Investigate the effect of root impedance on blah
	\item
	%These need to be filled in
	Investigate blah on wave reflections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discretization}

\begin{frame}{Numerical Solution $\&$ Development of a Code}
		\begin{block}
		A Two-Step Lax-Wendroff (Richtmyer) scheme is used. Equations~\ref{continuity} and \ref{consxmomentum} can be written in the following form:

		\begin{equation} 
			\label{discrete1}
			\partder{}{t} \tensor{U} + \partder{}{x} \tensor{R}(\tensor{U}) = \tensor{S}

\subsection{Outflow}
\begin{frame}{The structured tree}
	\begin{block}{Olufsen's}
		She retains no structure of the vessels within the tree and recalculates all this information for each structured tree.

			\label{radius}
			(r_0)_(n,k) = R_{root} \alpha^k\beta^{n-k}
		\end{equation}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Our's}
		We retain a structure of the tree by a vector of nodes containing certain information about the tree. 
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{bmatrix}
			Daughter \: 1 \; & Daughter \: 2 \; & Parent \; & Radius 
			\end{bmatrix}
		\end{equation}

	The pressure profile follows the same curve. The dicrotic notch is less visible in our implementation, and the magnitude is slightly higher.

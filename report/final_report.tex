\section{Introduction}
Using the paper reviewed in Journal Club, we attempted to implement the Structured Tree Outflow conditions for a One-D Vascular Model presented by Olufsen~\cite{olufsen}. The One-D model presented by Olufsen outlines a finite difference scheme for solving the Navier-Stokes equations; as such, we used this approach for implementation of our One-D model. We will briefly outline the purpose of using a Structured Tree model and the theory behind this implementation.%as well as potential points of error in the discretization.
We will then describe the process taken in implementing this code along with some issues encountered along the way. We will discuss the current state of our code as well as display some preliminary results of our implementation. Lastly, we will talk about a small study investigated using Olufsen's code. 

\section{Theory}

Modeling the human body, in the current state of being, is a complex and difficult process. Large 3D models that account for large portions of the human vasculature take immense amounts of computation time to solve for the flow within the body~\cite{someone}. On the other hand, smaller models that take into account the rest of the body as a set resistance or circuit (lumped parameter models) cannot accurately resolve the physiological wave reflections in the human vasculature~\cite{someone}. The Structured Tree One-D model lies somewhere in between the two complexities. It is a One-D model, so computational time is significantly decreases; in addition, the wave reflections of the human vasculature are captured because the impedance of the human body is modeled as an impedance based on frequency of the downstream vessels (The Structured Tree). %It is important to note that the formation of this tree, specifically the cut-off radius for the downstream vessels, is quite important for the solution. The effect of this cut-off radius is investigated later in the paper.

As is commonly the case, blood is modeled as an incompressible, non-newtonian fluid. The navier-stokes equation of motion are therefore applied to the fluid. Starting with a simplified version of continuity, we get Equation~\eqref{continuity}, and the simplified conservation of momentum in the x direction we get Equation~\eqref{consxmomentum}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{continuity}
	\partder{A}{t} + \partder{q}{x} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{consxmomentum}
	\partder{q}{t} + \partder{}{x}\Bigg(\frac{q^2}{A}\Bigg) + \frac{A}{p}\partder{p}{x} = -\frac{2R\pi \nu q}{\delta A}
\end{equation}

Talk about equation to relate pressure to area~\eqref{circ}
\begin{equation}
	\label{circ}
	\tau_\theta = \frac{r p_e}{h} = \frac{E_\theta}{1-\sigma_x\sigma_\theta}\frac{r-r_0}{r_0}
\end{equation}

and it gives Equation \eqref{ptoarea}, and ~\eqref{solvedp}

\begin{equation}
	\label{ptoarea}
	p-p_0 = \frac{4Eh}{3} \frac{r-r_0}{r*r_0}
\end{equation} 


\begin{equation}
	p(x,t) - p_0 = \frac{4}{3} \frac{Eh}{r_0(x)} \Bigg[1 - \sqrt{\frac{A_0(x)}{A(x,t)}}\Bigg]
	\label{solvedp}
\end{equation}
